 <br><br>The basic pattern: Luther started the Reformation in 1517. It took people<br>
about 30 years to settle in and pick sides. Then over the next 100 years<br>
they brutally tried to slaughter each other all over Europe. Thus the wars<br>
of religion fall from roughly 1550-1650.<br>Why did they kill each other so savagely over religion?<br>Heaven and hell were literal places for them. Hell meant eternal<br>
damnation and eternal torture. Real, physical torture. And there was only<br>
one true path to God. So, by definition, if you weren’t on the path to God,<br>
you were on the path to hell. Since the church you went to was obviously<br>
the correct path, any other path was the Devil’s path.<br>A heretic was more dangerous than a murderer. A murderer might kill your<br>
children – sad, yes, but then they go to God in heaven. A heretic threatens<br>
their immortal soul.<br>THey are going to kill each other becuase they are sure that theirs is the correct one, and the concepts of heaven and hell are real for them, as that is there reward then hell is afoul, dante dipicts hell, demons draging people to hell, so you have to make sure your on the right path, and the other sides path is the devils path, if your not working wtih god your with the devil, and luthern said to kill the peasant, against the church a heritict, and a murder could snatch up your kid and kill him so he goes to heaven but a heritic could send them to hell. and what is going to heappen when we die, idea of deavil and demons is a real thing in their minds. the Ideas of demons being around cus they dont under stand science, black cats are the devil hard to see in the dark,<br><br><a data-href="Dutch Revolt Against Spain" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/Dutch Revolt Against Spain" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dutch Revolt Against Spain</a> 1566-1588 (officially 1648)<br><a data-href="French Civil War" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/French Civil War" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">French Civil War</a>, 1562-1598<br>(<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="French Civil War" data-href="French Civil War" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/French Civil War" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">War of the 3 Henrys</a>)<br><a data-href="Thirty Years War" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chaper-13/things/thirty-years-war.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Thirty Years War</a>, 1618-1648<br>(In a later chapter)<br>netherlands is controled by spain,<br><br>The Spanish Habsburgs ruled the Netherlands.<br>The Habsburgs were (very!)

not be able to threaten England or the Netherlands<br>
again.<br>Functionally the northern part of the Netherlands was<br>
independent after 1588, but it wasn’t formally<br>
recognized until the end of the Thirty Years War in<br>
1648.<br>At the time of the Armada, Spain<br>
controlled the southern half of the<br>
Netherlands, which they kept – it<br>
became Catholic Belgium. The<br>
northern ½ is the Netherlands.<br>The netherlands halland and dutch spainsih habesburgs have diffrent culture, and the problem is that a lot of th poeple in the netherlands are calvisits and protestent, and the habsburgs want the netherlands to put back to the catholic church,  the dutch dont like toture and the dutch rebell against the spainsh and to the west they are anglican, and the british sayign that they will help them out leeding to the spanish trying to invade them, spain england not going good, the spaich arrmada is confrunted by the bristish navy and they lose, they were the top and they get beat due to the weather and size of the ships, they are shoked and not longer that big of that deal the nertherlands and halland spilt, and belgium, and netherland, mulitplue countires fighting each other over what they oginnaly was relgion, and shows coutrys aren't cool with being told what to do, not simmilar so no control spanish. <br>the french, is catholic country, very very catholic country, <br><br>1562-98<br>France was 90% Catholic, but 10%<br>
Huguenot.<br>Although a minority, the Huguenots<br>
included many wealthy people and<br>
nobles. For many this was an excuse<br>
to oppose the King.<br>Huguenots were frequently persecuted<br>The St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre –<br>
1572<br>Across France thousands died –<br>
estimates range from 5,000 to<br>
30,000.<br>gets really bad in franch, the huganot is the protestent, 90% is catholic, every one, but 10% are huguenot french word for protestent, noblity were more huguenot because they were sayign that they didn't need to listion to the rule, and its alot of poeple with a fair amount of power, and a lot have private armies and castales, but they are purscuteted they are not well liked, they are seen going against relgioun, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre -- 1572, nad the marige was to calm tentions, then his friends were huguenots and they get killed, and they say that cathrine midice did it, and 5000 to 30,000 and some catholics die not much tho, its all about power and what relgion you are, and a king gets shot in the face accadently in celabration, <br>Henry III – The King of France. Catholic<br>Henry of Guise – a powerful Noble. Catholic<br>Henry of Navarre – Leader of the Huguenots<br>Clearly this war was about more than just religion.<br>henry of navarrre is the groum and the day of the massecure, and they all fight for the thorown, its more then about relgion, the henry 3 and henry of Guise are both catholic, henry the III get assasinated and Henry of Guise get assasinated, <br>Oddly the King was not the strongest force in the war.<br>
The other nobles held more land and had more troops.<br>The war dragged on for decades and devastated<br>
France.<br>Eventually Henry III was assassinated and numerous<br>
people in France sought some form of settlement so<br>
that peace could be restored.<br>Henry of Navarre was the last Henry standing – and he<br>
also happened to be the next heir to the throne after<br>
the death of his cousin, Henry III. Plus, he was married<br>
to the late kings sister. Henry of Navarre became<br>
Henry IV.<br>He later converted to Catholicism to be acceptable to<br>
the majority of the population.<br>Henry the III wwas not the strogest and hnry of Guise is quiet much stronger, and 3 guys fighting for the crown, and the people are the lossers they, henry III and Henry of Guise gets Assaniated, people wanted to find a way to peace<br>
henry of navarre is the last standing if they bring him in they would have a protestnet king in a catholic country, and henry of navarre has to make a desciaion of conversion, and he is henry the IV to, and difficult desciions to make, and the 30 plus years of death, and he converts, and paris is well wourth aa mass, he wants to save lives, and he says he is willing to give up his religion to save poeple, and he get assasinated ]]></description><link>https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chaper-13/day-10-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10th graade/AP EURO/AP eupo/Chaper 13/day 10 2.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 15:19:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[day 10 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[

nobles were extremely powerful in their own area<br>
kings were very dependent on nobles as soldiers, local officials, and tax collectiors<br><br>Kings attempted to centralized power in the royal government<br>
Large permanent armies under the directerd authourtiy of the kings,<br>
utilized the newly emergin the middle class ot balance the pwoer of nobles<br>and permant armies, they make a buracrachy,<br>
and once your in the permant armie your in it, you dont go back to the farms,<br>middle class having power and deciding stuff, and kings and queens are becoming the true controler, <br>power if finit, if I gain power you lose power, and so kings and queens gain power and nobles lose it,<br>and machivel gains helps show how to do it, "Machievlis guild to be a ruler 101"<br><br>spain becomes very power then they lose their power, they hire chirtoferph later,<br>
they were llike itliy,<br>
Ferdinand and ISabella,<br>
Spain was very diverse culturar, lots of muslims and jews,<br>
muslims control a lot of the south of spain,<br>ANd jewish people living in spain, were able to lend money at intrest, chiratins were not allowed to due that, then the reconquista, reconquest fo spain was complete it was unified politically under catholic rule, <br>they've read alot of documents, <br>They becoem new manarches, and how acculay runs the goverment, and medivel peirod was land to nobles, <br>Ferdinand and Isabella want to be them in power,<br><br>You cant jsut take titles,<br>
in spain they create brother hoods which work at the local level, and slow down the vilance of other nobles, nobles were fairly violant and the brother hoods were the police and the judges and they take the job of the nobles and they say they dont care but some that may be a judge is now not their power, so they took some of their responcibles,<br>Royal councils, king arther, and its filled with noblity, and it was passed down, they expected to be on the council, they are respoible for these churhc, taxes, armies, etc,<br>
and they replace the noble men on the counicle and now it was the middle class that was on the table,<br>
they aren't high class or low class, not about money, some are filthy rich middle class, they get appointed, and they get persteage with their job, they dont have land or titles,<br>
but the merchants are secratery of this, and they owed their job to king and they were loyal to the king, and as noblilty they couldn't say anthing, and now these avg day people, to collect the taxes, be the judges, and they hire an accountent to handle the moeny, and the noblie men are denide more power, and middle class ppeople are loyal to the king, And they dont work for the duke or the count, and its not spread out and in their pocet,<br>
But if your middle class and take money you could die, <br>Take their power  (resposiblety) not their title or land or stuff<br>and to take some power for the church, make everyone practice the same religion, and control that religion, target the two most powerful orginizations and take that power as a king, and how to take power for the chuch<br>
and you cant jsut kill the pope, but you can take some of his power,<br>
i<br><br>And if your a diffrent relgion of the ruler, and if you are muslim or jewish you leave the country or you convert,<br>And they make a deal with the pope, the spaiish king appoints spaish bishopes, will set you up for life, collect taxes for the churchs, and you get appointed by the king you have loyalty to the king but now the deal allows for the king to be the mini pope rather then the pope, and a great deal, <br>increase the royal power, take power from other groups, dont endanger yourself,<br>
and if your jewish or musims, get out or convert, how do you know if they converted, and the jewish faimlys lived for decades and more and years, and its hard to pack up to leave, and so they say they will convert, and cathlics were affrade they were, and if you were accused you were basciy dead, and lets say you dont eat the pork, they wouldn't eat the food, and torture the, and the spainsih inquistion it wasn't everybody and if you were accused you lose property, and they kicked out all the smart people, so now it was brain drain, spain makes their own brian drain, so that mkaes a problem, but the kings become very very powerful, they would skin their feet, <br><br>

 <br>"Community controls refer to the social mechanisms within a community that regulate and influence individuals' behavior, particularly regarding moral conduct, social roles, and power dynamics. These controls were enforced through societal expectations, informal sanctions, and public opinion. The community often had a direct influence on the lives of individuals, including marriage, family life, and social behavior, especially in rural and small-town settings during the early modern period.

 <br>"Definition: A consumer society refers to a social order where the acquisition of goods and services plays a central role in individuals' lives and identities. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the rise of consumerism was closely tied to the growth of the middle class, increased urbanization, and the expansion of global trade. People began spending more time and resources buying goods, which were often seen as symbols of status and identity. Consumerism led to the development of new markets, advertising, and a shift in social values towards materialism and consumption." -notmine]]></description><link>https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-17/link-it-up/consumer-society.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10th graade/AP EURO/AP eupo/Chapter 17/Link it up/Consumer Society.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:10:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cottage Industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Jenner observed that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox did not get smallpox, leading him to hypothesize that exposure to cowpox could protect against smallpox. He tested this idea by inoculating a young boy with cowpox and later exposing him to smallpox, finding that the boy did not develop the disease.

It was a reaction against what Wesley saw as the declining spirituality of the Church of England. The Methodists were known for their methodical approach to religious practice (hence the name) and for their focus on social reform, including advocating for the poor and marginalized.

 <br>The open field system was a system in which a community of a village would have a shared land, which they would harvest and decide on the crops.<br>Divided in several large fields, which were in turn cut up into long, narrow strips.<br>The strips were had not been enclosed into small plots, still being open to anyone or thing.<br>The whole village followed a pattern of plowing, sowing, and harvesting in accordance with the traditions that have been around for a long time.<br>What was the reason behind using this system?
The reason behind this system was to give a full community effort. Where in this case everyone would work to gather as a sorta hive mind.
<br>What was a major deficiency of this system?
This system was deficient when it came to innovation because if someone wanted to try crop rotation for the first time everyone would have to come to a consensus and that made it really difficult because not everyone would be willing to do that because it wasn't a long standing tradition.

 <br><br><br>Watch AP Euro Bit-by-Bit #23 (and the first 7:30 of Crash Course #8) and answer the following questions (Ch 17 pages 494-503)<br>
NOTE: Up to this moment, we have really been focusing on many of the major political, religious, and economic developments that were occurring in Europe beginning with the rise of the Renaissance in the early 1400s, the development of multiple Christian denominations during the 1500s, and all culminating in the development of absolutism throughout much of Europe by the early 1700s. However, while these events and movements did significantly impact the over-all course of Europe’s development on a continental scale, for the vast number of Europeans living during this time period, the day-to-day life experiences from generation to generation did not change all that drastically. Remember, although influential, the middle class by no means was a true representation of Europe’s population as a whole. By the late 1600s, at least 80% of the Western European population still relied on agriculture as their primary livelihood and this number was certainly higher in the kingdoms of Eastern Europe.<br>
<br>1.Describe the purpose of the Open-field system of agriculture. GoTo <a data-href="Open field system" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-17/link-it-up/open-field-system.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Open field system</a>
Open field system<br><br>The open field system was a system in which a community of a village would have a shared land, which they would harvest and decide on the crops.<br>Divided in several large fields, which were in turn cut up into long, narrow strips.<br>The strips were had not been enclosed into small plots, still being open to anyone or thing.<br>The whole village followed a pattern of plowing, sowing, and harvesting in accordance with the traditions that have been around for a long time.<br>What was the reason behind using this system?
The reason behind this system was to give a full community effort. Where in this case everyone would work to gather as a sorta hive mind.
<br>What was a major deficiency of this system?
This system was deficient when it came to innovation because if someone wanted to try crop rotation for the first time everyone would have to come to a consensus and that made it really difficult because not everyone would be willing to do that because it wasn't a long standing tradition.

<br>NOTE: During the 1700s, England and the Netherlands led, what historians now refer to as, an Agricultural Revolution. Drawing upon the ideas of the Scientific Revolution, these countries worked towards improving agricultural output, making use of a variety of new technology, methods, and access to new foods.<br>2. One of the major innovations during the Agricultural Revolution was the use of crop rotation. What is Crop Rotation and why was it an improvement over the open field system?
<a data-href="Crop Rotation" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-17/link-it-up/crop-rotation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Crop Rotation</a> Crop Rotation<br><br>Crop Rotation is like the name implies the rotation of crops to allow for the fields to be replenished, this would lead to the end of the one thirds field system as crop rotation would allow for crops to be replenished <br>
It is an improvement over the open field system as the open field system would be a consensus with the community so change would be hard so it would still be the continuation of the one thirds field system so it would also then give nuitreinst to the soil and crops.
<br>2a. How did it also impact livestock (and thus ultimately people’s diets)?
This would give more food for the live stock as there would be more food for the people. So it would impact their diet by giving more protein / nutrients into their diet. 
<br>3. How did the Columbian Exchange ultimately impact the Agricultural Revolution in Europe?
The Columbian Exchange impacted the Agricultural Revolution in Europe by giving rise to crop rotation which came about due to the enclosure movement and that collimated to give a better diet. And crop rotation could come about due to the New Crops coming from the Columbain Exchange.
<br>3a. According to John Greene (Crash Course), why is the potato the world’s most important plant of the last 500 years?
<a data-href="day 12 12 crash course number 8" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-17/textnotes/day-12-12-crash-course-number-8.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">day 12 12 crash course number 8</a> &lt;&lt; notes on video<br>
John Greene stated that the potato didn't need great soil. So with that they could be planted pretty much anywhere and they would grow.
<br>4. In what sense did Jethro Tull’s seed drill represent not only a mechanical but also a scientific agricultural improvement?
Jethro Tull's seed drill represent a mechanical improvement because it was the yield improvement in the field for the seed were planted into the soil which then would allow them to germinate better which is the scientific advanment.
<br><br><br>5. What was the enclosure movement and how did it represent a more scientific approach to agriculture?
The enclosure movement was<br>
<a data-href="ENCLOSURE MOVEMENT" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-17/link-it-up/enclosure-movement.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ENCLOSURE MOVEMENT</a>  ENCLOSURE MOVEMENT<br><br>The enclouse movemnt was a movemnet in which large land owners would buy out or take the land of the peaseants and enclose it with something like fences, <br>Nobles also would take thier land share and enclose it off,<br>this would kick out peasants farmers with led to the decline of population in rural community's and this would lead to ppl needing work so they could survive. And this would also lead to the <a data-href="Cottage Industry" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-17/link-it-up/cottage-industry.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cottage Industry</a>.<br>
it represented the ability for more land to be used for experiments like the new idea of <a data-href="crop rotation" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-17/link-it-up/crop-rotation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">crop rotation</a>. 
<br>5a. How did it impact the land owners?
First the peasant farmers were forced to sell their land because they could not longer use the commons. So they would have to die, more to town to find work or start work in the <a data-href="cottage industry" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-17/link-it-up/cottage-industry.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">cottage industry</a><br>
Second would be the gentlemen farmer which they would buy the land that the peasant farmers left and would begin to stuff to make money.
<br>5b. How did it impact the peasant farmers?

<br>Forced to sell their land 
<br>Find new work or starve.

<br>Brain Challenge #1:&nbsp; Who benefits?<br>
The agricultural revolution had a significantly different impact on the rich and the poor. How a person felt about the developments might well depend on their social status<br>
<br>How did the agricultural revolution impact wealthy landowners?

<br>The ag revolution impacted the wealthy landowners by allowing them to experiment and they could purchase more land.


<br>How did the agricultural revolution impact poor farmers?

<br>The Ag. revolution impacted the poor farmers leading them to leave, starve to death, or work in the putting out industry.&nbsp;


<br>Given both its short and long-term impacts, was the agricultural revolution a good thing?

<br>The short term impacts were wealthy landowners were they would make more money while at the misery of the poor farmers who had to find another way to survive or die.&nbsp;    
<br>The long term impacts would be the mass production of food that would be provided, giving rise to putting out industry.    
<br>Overall the agricultural revolution was a good thing because the consequences outweigh the actions that affected the poor farmers because people have more food so less people will die of starvation.


<br>6. In a nutshell, what were the major impacts of the agricultural revolution on European society (especially the British and the Dutch)? Be sure to give a brief description of each impact.

<br>Healthier life more nutrients in food,
<br>More land for the Dutch becasue they got rid of the low land waters
<br>More food from the use of crop rotation
<br>Encolusre movement which drove peasant farmers to work in a town or in the cttage industy 

<br><br><br>NOTE: As shown by the previous section, the agricultural revolution during the late 17 th and early 18 th centuries had a dramatic impact on society. That said, it must be noted that these impacts varied from region to region depending on things such as how aggressive countries were in implementing these new techniques and ideas as well as what political system was in use at the time (think Eastern vs Western absolutism as well as absolutism vs constitutional systems). With that in mind, these movements eventually led to what is now referred to as the industrious revolution (not to be confused with the industrial revolution). Watch AP Euro Bit-by-Bit #24 and answer the following questions (Ch 17 pages 503-508)<br>7. Since the Middle Ages, many businesses had operated under the Guild system. In general, what was a Guild?
A guild was like a govermental deparment but it had nothing to due with the goverment,
<br>7a. What were the benefits of the guild system?
They would train workers, they had fixed prices for what was sold, they gave fair wages, and regulated waht was sold
<br>7b. What were some disadvantages of the guild system?
The guild system would curb inovation into new tech that wouldn't be work done by man. And they would run you out of town if you were not affiliated with the guild.
<br>8. Describe the putting-out system. How did it work?
The beginning of the putting out system was were a wealthy business owner would give raw products to a worker and they would make a quota and they would get a wage, then later in the putting out system workers would become speiclized, they also didn't own the object that were made. that being uselly textiles.
<br>Brain Challenge #2: Urban vs. Rural<br>
In modern America we usually associated the manufacturing of goods with large urban factories,<br>
yet the first significant production of for-market production took place in rural areas. (Cottage<br>
industry and the putting out system.) In the early modern era what were the advantages or<br>
disadvantages offered by each of the following locations:<br>
<br>Urban Areas:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>Infrastructure for transportation was a lot better in urban areas because of the greater development in their economy.
<br>Guilds regulated skilled labor, so being able to hire them.


<br>Rural Areas:

<br>There was poor infrastructure which could hinder the transportation of materials and products.&nbsp;
<br>Guilds didn’t regulation so there is a lack of skilled labor.


<br>9. What was the reason for the development of what became known as the putting-out system (or Cottage industry)?
The formation of colonies that did not have the mean to produce the textiles
<br>9a. Why was this advantageous for entrepreneurs?
Because they could make a lot of money 
<br>9b. Why was this advantageous for farm laborers?
They may make more money 
<br><br><br>10. When compared with cottage industries, list and give a description of 2 advantages of the guild system.

<br>Standerided wages
<br>Better work safety/ workers comp.

<br>NOTE: As you have hopefully realized, both the agricultural revolution and the industrious revolution (including the putting out system) resulted, not only from the implementation of ideas stemming from the Scientific Revolution, but also from the age of exploration (including the colonization of the New World along and expanded trade with Africa and Asia). Pages 634-647in the textbook serve as a good review of this material. Watch the Enlightenment Thinkers video (4:25-10:30) AND read the textbook pages 508--514, then answer the following questions<br>11. What were the main ideas behind the economic theory of mercantilism?
Gain more gold from exports and don't lose gold due to imports
<br>11a. In this system (mercantilism), what was the role of the government?
The role of the government would be the main regulator and controler it wasn't as laissez-faire
<br>NOTE: Whereas many Enlightenment ideas such as freedom of speech and religious belief conflicted with restrictions resulting from stringent political systems such as absolutism, the ideas of Adam Smith focused more on problems stemming from the absolutist economic theory of the time: Mercantilism. His book, Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) established the basis for modern economics.<br>12. How did the Enlightenment idea of selfishness and the individual play a role in Adam Smith’s economic theory?
It would tie into a laissez-faire system where individuals of a society would control the market a free market, as they would have control they could decided what they do as they see fit.
<br>12a. According to Smith, what is the Invisible Hand? (why is it invisible?)

 <br>the Revolution in Politics, 1775 - 1815<br>(the french revolution and napoleon)<br>removing the head of a person showing the removal goverment<br>change, it takes a lot of time, <br> a room with a gas, you only really notice it once it blows up,<br><br>why france was ready to explode<br>
<br>unequl social classes
<br>enlightment ideas
<br>examples of other recolutions
<br>bad harvest/famine
<br>financial crisis
<br>poor leadership
<br>france from the out side looks Great, but on the inside there is much termoil, there is that facade, so very big problems, <br>real issues, unequal soical classes, <br>people are writing usling giuatines 1977 first star wars movie comes out for frnaces<br><br>French society was legally Divided into 3 separate estate, (classes),<br>
1st Estate -- clergy (church)<br>
2nd Estate -- nobility<br>
3rd estate -- every one else<br>this isnt new forever it has been like,<br>teh first two estates enjoeyed many legal privileges,<br>
over the third estate<br>
tax exemption,<br>
got all the best jobs (goverment jobs, church jobs are amazing paid and not taxed a place to live you collet money)<br>
required to be believed in court; don't question em, third is at a whole diffrent level,<br>
masive inequality<br>
could often harm the third estate with no repercussions, you can punch down but not up, noble mand can get away with stuff, church can get away with moral problems,<br><br>in a worrld of absolute monarchy, brutal inequality and crushing provery philosophes sat around talking about wonderful ideas, limited monarchy<br>
natrual rights, life liberty property<br>
equality beofre the law<br>
fredom of speech,<br>but none of that is happening in the pratical world, <br>france is an example of heres what I say but this is what I do,<br>
the gas leak, a lot of enlightend people, <br>they weren't ready to kill leiws <br><br>Examples of other revolutions<br>britains glorious revolution in 1688:<br>
an absusive king was removed from power bill of Right demanded.<br>the american revolution began in 1776: an abusive goverment was thrown aside in favor of democracy.<br>
done with french aid -- french troops were there and saw it happen<br>
the great relstion ship with france and america, the statue of liberty,<br>the french and british have very discritaly view of amricans<br>if a bunch of colonial hicks can do it, surely the French can, <br>4 minute mile, they thought it would kill you then ppl start to break it,<br><br>96-97% of the people were ready to kickem ,<br>

nglishtment ideas, Lockes stuff,<br>
proof that it could be<br>
exsample of america and england, and will and marry sign not in threat,<br>the first treee casues created an environment in which france was ready to explode -- alll it would tkae is a spark to set it off.<br>
it jsut isn't bequem, not to noticeable if you part of the solons, merchants lawers and banker,s<br><br>1788 and 1789 saw extremely bad harvests. people who aready lived on the edge could no longer survive. bread supper supper important,<br>
rember, when people are starvign theey are despeate the dont just roll over and die and say ah shucks and die they fight they steall they riot! they do whatever they have to do so that they and their families can survive.<br>
peopel with food are the heath care ceo target,<br>the goverm\nment was failing these people in thier time of need.<br>many of the major events of 1789 1789 1789 1789 1789 17891 789 1789 1789 1789 1789 17891 7891 1789 1789 1789 1789 begin as bread riots.<br>
like black friday, where they would trample people and then look at the beread<br><br>this doesn't mean the economy was bad-- institution called the goverment had no money.<br>
it was buried i ndebt  think abotu lousi XIV<br>
is was so far in debt that the entiere income in taxs for the year 1789 wouldn't have paid the INTREST that they owed that year on the debt they had,<br>the only was to solve the problem was to tax the nobles, but to do that they would have call the estates general which had not met in well over 100 YEARS!]]></description><link>https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-19/day-12-18.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10th graade/AP EURO/AP eupo/chapter 19/day 12 18.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 16:24:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[day 12 19]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>the rich had duck peasant, food,<br><br>Louis XVI -- not a bad man or a cruel king compared to most monarchs. but very indecisive.<br>
e, a very intlectuiles, not godo at dessions, and he is not that guy, marrie would set the clocks an hour ahead,<br>
when the revolution expoldes, he proves unable to solve the problem.<br>
his answer to the forming of the estates genral locking a door.<br>Queen Marie Antoinette -- she had no real power in the goverment and thus can't be blamed for the problems. but she was immensely unpopular.<br>Marie amtoinette's peasant village at verssilles <br>the diverse enature of the 3rd estate<br>bourgeoisie -- wealthy, educated, enlightened (the have like everything cept a title )<br>
ana culttes - urban workers, more liberal<br>
rural workers -- tradotional, religious, conservations<br>
roughly 96% of the population,<br>rural worker  will like a rulers the most,<br>the bougeoisie and the sans culottes are not a fan \<br><br>a country that is going to expole with an esate system that ahs been around for a long time the tention is building and now with the reneissace and the enlightenment and they sya jsut dcus this is how its been does, the american revolutions 12 years, and the english revolution a while ago the room with gas<br>

 <br><br><br>was the center of culture and intellectual life leading revolution. Was first to establish a constitutional monarchy and a rapid republic and napoleons empire. <br>They made strides in reforming power for the rights of people.<br><br>Keeps the same-ish structure with the fuedual system<br>So the social structure of the middle ages in france broke down a lot over time during the french revolution, riding of estates.<br><br><br>
<br>That equality between men and women was neither practical nor desirable
<br>Superiority of people of european descent over those of indigenous or african origin.
<br>Never believedd that everyone should be equal economiclly.
<br>**<br>Brain Challenge #1<br>Part A: Given your responses to the preceding questions (1 &amp; 2), why did the idea that a societal revolution was imminent make sense?<br>The idea that a societal revolution makes sense is because the proletariat in france were ‘slaves’ to the bourgeoisie. The proletariat were starving on the streets while the estates above 1 and 2 made Enlightenment ideas such as liberty, equality and freedom. But nonetheless who cares for the 3 estate peoples starving on the streets. And the bubble exploded leading to revolution upon the class system. Thus the idea that a societal revolution being imminent makes sense as people were ready to oppose oppression and be given the right to live.<br>Part B: Given your responses to the preceding questions (1 &amp; 2), why might a revolution during the late 18th and/or early 19th century become socially divisive?&nbsp;<br>A revolution during the late 18th and/or early 19th century would become socially divisive because Liberty didn’t mean equality. Women would not have the same rights as man. Racism present wouldn’t playing too much. And a believe that economic equality shouldn’t exist. This would greatly impact many groups and thus leading to a socially divisive revolution.<br>**<br><br>Britan vs. france whos going to win..... No one as every one loses in war. War was in place in europe with europeans conflicting thoughts with rivalries and diplomatic schematic intricacies. Were someone want land and the other has the land and wants to keep it.  <br>It was about the alliances and power struggles occurring.<br><br>This reminds me of the cold war times. <br>They brought their problems to colonies and effecting trade.<br><br>Bro, they were the country where the sun never set. So when claiming everying they could set their eyes on that was easy to take they did. Becoming an imperial power. With global dominance<br><br>First estate are the cleargy the people of the church. They had a lot of rights similair to Second estate<br>Second Estate are the noblity Bourgeoise, they held the best rights, their word is taken over any one else. exempt taxes<br>Third estate are eveeryone else, they held the least rights, they are the back bone representing 97% of the people.<br><br>He would make reforms like that of taxing everyone instead of only the thrid estate, and reform the coutntry this was easire said then done because people dont like being taxed in the slightest.<br><br>THE FRIST SECOND HAD ALL THE POWER OVER THE THIRD ESSTATE EVEN WHEN THE THIRD ESTATE HAD 97% OF THE POPULATION. SO THE SECOND AND FIRST ESTATE COULD SET ANYTHING FOR THE THIRD ESTATE WITH OUT IT'S ABBILITY TO DO ANYTHING.<br>6a. They made the tennis court oath, making a national assembly, and some progressibe member of first and second joined/allied.<br>6b. he mostly ignored it, hes a bad leader he doesn't really know what to do. So he tried to just keep his pwoer that he had and try and sqoush them which did do so well.<br><br>The weather sucked man like yesterday it started to snow and I know people are proble not happy with that cus you have to snow blow. So harsh winter of 1788-1789, droughtss 1787 1788, which just leads up to total disparity so its the poor harvests.<br><br>The bastile is such a big deal because it housed old retires, nah jokeing, It because it held lots of ammo and weapons giveing the national assemmbly/revolutionays the power to fight back.<br><br>rural france was freacked out they might die form rumurs of death coming thier way in the form of armmys. No it whas a wave of panic by rural france driveing by the rurmurs of the arictocratic planes of attack, but the peasents got the upper hand and attaccked first destorying records and such. this would be the collpase of tradinal authority.<br><br>Becuase it made use of Enlightenment ideas like eqaulity before the law and individual liberty , freedom of speech and resistance to the oppression. And it legitimizred the revolution delarcing sovereignty.<br><br>They are now a rebuplic, universal male suffrage, you can practice and religion, women still were mostly ignored and thougth that they shouldn't have rights.<br><br>edmund burke thought that revolution what a very bad thing that would lead to chaos and tyranny.<br>
Mary Wollstonecraft support revolution she wanted equality, the need for reforms.<br>
Kings and nobles of other European countries, they feared revoultion is france gets it done well then what about my power, they opposed revoultion heavllity. and resutling in wars aimed at restorying the monarchy.<br><br>Jacobins were radical political group advocation for democracy and equalit. It was moderate idealigical reforms to more radical for equaltiy and liberty even throught the means of violence.<br><br>Inside of france they knew that he could not be trusted in the slightest. And outside they thought that treating a ruler as a pirsioner as the worst crime on earth.<br><br>They now have war with many countries as war with its neighbors. And the domestic situation within france was bad as well because there was counter revolutionarys, and they there is soon to be the rain of terror.<br><br>The Committee of Public Safety's purpose is to curb anything that goes against the revolutionaries. <br><br>
<br>Just kill them
<br>fear
<br>you just had to be called an opposer and you would be killed.
<br><br>The creation of a dictator ship, robespiere had the ability to just kill really anyone he saw fit.<br><br>"THermidorain Reaction -- end of the radical revolution<br>
afte a eyar of robes peire people turn on him and kill him he is like the late victom, they would kill everyone, and a teen kid is kill who took food off a tree, a lot of people hate robespierre, gorge danton is eexecuted they try to get rid of the radical goverment, to turn it back down the jacobinds, the bored of directors the directory, get rid of the committee and now dirrectory people like revoulitions until it goes to far to kill a king for him did he do much and to be executed by your goverment, a lot of people who support the revolution, and the method of executeion and debated how long the head stay alive, do they know they are dead, deabate of if they are aware of what is going on, they had radicals and not it is turned around and wealhty merchants want better trade."<br><br>The directory was a group of royalists, and they only did what they could to gain power for them self. And it was a reaction to the goverment of the second revoultion because like a pendulum swing far right then swing far left. <br><br>Napoleon Bonaparte was used as a trusty pawn one that was given a little to much trust as he was to over through the directory and resulted in him have the keys to the castle. <br><br>teh napoleonic code was a set of standards like IEEE, ISO, UN, EU, or just any regulator; impacting france and europe because it set standards for how people should be treated and the morals and such.<br>
Creation of the Bank of France and the reoganization of the Bureaucracy - to stablize the french economy and it gave economic stabilization centralized power and was used for control. and the bureaucracy was used as a way to set up a merit base system of civil service. WHich would give more power to Napoleon as he could control his empire a lot better.<br>
Concordat it was the establishment of church back in france, and it gave napoleon similair power to isabella and ferdanand, So it limited the power of the church.<br>
Creation of the Grand Empire was Napoleons lands that were under his control that gave him the power of almost conrol of europe, lots of coutrys had to provide for the benift of france not prioritizing there selfs.<br><br>England created problems for napoleon because now people still thing he is short. And england was an island having the strongest navel power overwhelming the artillery ability that napoleon relied on. Because it was a water battle not a land one which napoleon was only good at artilitary. So england was a pain becuase they like the french castle in Monty python and the Holy Grail could berate napoleon just like The Alexsander guy. And they couldn't do anything about it thye would just fail. <br><br>France's revolution inspired hati to declare independence bacause it was on the back burner and wasn't being watched so they could break free from control. And pay france leading to econamic poverty present today. <br>**<br>Brain Challenge #2: Evaluate the extent to which the women’s march to Versailles (on Oct 5, 1789) represented the ideals presented in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.<br>There was a high extent to which the women’s march to Versailles (on Oct 5, 1789) represented the ideals presented in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. Women would demand justice, equality and rights to shaping the nations development. But the document only cared about the man. As the women marched to Versailles in dire need of bread to feed their starving family.&nbsp; They had enough of the incompetent rule of the monarchs and wished for socioeconomic reforms they shouldn’t be unequal or at the very least left to starve. The extent is thus high as women demand reform representing the equality in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.<br>**<br>**<br>Brain Challenge #3:&nbsp; Voice of the Revolution<br><br>**<br>**<br>Brain Challenge #4: To what extent were the actions of the Committee of Public Safety successful in dealing with the problems faced by France in 1793 and 1794? Why? (Explain your answer)<br>There was a high extent of success in the action of the Committee of Public Safety when dealing with the problems of France in 1793 and 1794. As the Committee murdered any opposers to the revolutionaries, akin to being called a communist in america in the cold war or that of the salem witch trials. Where dead men tell no tails, all the Committee had to do is eradicate those who maybe opposed to the revolutionaries. Indubitably this may have caused the deaths of innocent lives, but hey if there is no one to oppose you then that means your fixin’ the problems. And when you make food a set price and enact mass conscription, your action ought to be consider for the greater good. So the actions of the Committee of Public Safety would be considered successful in dealing with the problems faced by France even when they were brutal in their methods.<br>**]]></description><link>https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/ap-euro/ap-eupo/chapter-19/main-notes-for-submission-chapter-19th.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10th graade/AP EURO/AP eupo/chapter 19/Main notes For submission Chapter 19th.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 14:29:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Absenteeism]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/?query=tag:vocab" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#vocab</a>

Heller Professor of Law at the UC Berkeley School of Law, Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, and Visiting Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and Ivana Stradner, research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, 3-17-2020, "The U.S. Must Reject the International Criminal Court’s Attack on Its National Sovereignty", National Review, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/united-states-must-reject-international-criminal-court-attack-on-national-sovereignty/%5C%5D/Kankee" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/united-states-must-reject-international-criminal-court-attack-on-national-sovereignty/%5C%5D/Kankee" target="_blank">https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/united-states-must-reject-international-criminal-court-attack-on-national-sovereignty/\]/Kankee</a><br>Last week, the International Criminal Court (ICC) authorized an investigation of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity by U.S., Afghan, and Taliban troops in Afghanistan, as well as by CIA black sites operated in Poland, Lithuania, and Romania. While the prosecution will likely fail, it represents another effort by a global elite — consisting of European governments, international organizations, and their supporting interest groups, academics, and activists — to threaten American sovereignty. The Rome Statute, which established the ICC in 1998, was supported by 120 states. It had the worthy goal of preventing the world’s most horrific crimes. Today the ICC can exercise jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, aggression, and genocide. Its founders believed that an international organization in the form of a court could replace the customary role of nation-states to punish those who violate the rules of civilized warfare. The Clinton administration signed the treaty in 2000, but did not submit it for Senate ratification. American support for the court dissolved after 9/11, as American officials worried that the ICC would become an anti-American kangaroo court used by certain countries to constrain nation-state sovereignty. In 2002, the Bush administration announced that it would not sign the agreement, and empowered then-State Department official John Bolton to lead a U.S. campaign to sign bilateral immunity agreements with more than 100 countries to protect both parties from the ICC’s jurisdiction. Ever since, the ICC has labored ineffectually. To date, the Court has spent more than $2 billion dollars and yielded just eight successful convictions and four acquittals, focusing only on African countries. While there are 123 member states, nations that still might have to wage war, such as the U.S., Israel, India, South Korea, China, and Russia, have refused to join. America’s Western European allies, perhaps still hoping for a utopian future where war has disappeared and meager conventional forces are all that is needed, lend the ICC its greatest support. Most ICC officials have long hoped to achieve international relevance by attacking the ICC’s greatest critic: the United States. Since November 2017, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has sought to use alleged crimes in Afghanistan to bring charges against the U.S. military and intelligence community. America’s response has been tough, and after numerous threats by the ICC, U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo ordered the revocation of the ICC chief prosecutor’s U.S. entry visa (though Bensouda managed to circumvent the ban and attend her UN meetings last April). The ICC Pre-Trial Chamber later ruled against an investigation (and possible prosecution) of the U.S. for alleged crimes in Afghanistan because both would most likely fail. Last week, however, the ICC’s appellate court reversed this finding and allowed Bensouda to continue her pursuits of American activities in Afghanistan and elsewhere after 9/11. To end this charade, the U.S. should continue to challenge the Court’s jurisdiction and protect the rights of nations that are bound only by rules to which they consent. The Trump administration should continue to deny ICC officials and any government officials (such as any military or law enforcement officers) that assist them from entering the United States or using its financial system. Most important, the United States should strike at the ICC through its supporters. Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada, Spain, Mexico, and Australia are all major Court funders. The Trump administration should warn countries who are ICC top funders yet depend utterly on the U.S. for their defense (such as Japan) that they cannot expect American troops to protect any nation seeking to prosecute and imprison them. It should weaken defense ties with ICC member countries, and cut foreign aid to any nation that cooperates with the Court. With these actions, the Trump administration will defend the rights, not just of the United States, but of all sovereign nations. America did not join the Rome Statute. It remains unfettered by its requirements. To protect international law, it should refuse to recognize any ICC probe. International rules should only bind nations that consent to them. Allowing the ICC to claim power over the U.S., which does not consent to its jurisdiction will erode any incentive to obey any international rules at all. The ICC’s actions threaten the only true mechanism for deterring human rights abuses. Subjecting U.S. forces to an after-the-fact and idealistic human-rights barometer will only discourage Washington from intervening to end massive human-rights abuses in difficult world hotspots. If the global elite want the U.S. to lead efforts to end killings in places such as Syria, Yemen, or Sudan, the last thing it should do is prosecute American troops when they take on the difficult jobs that no other nation can or will do.]]></description><link>https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/deabete/neg.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10th graade/Deabete/Neg.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 22:52:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reading Briefs]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The body of literature offers some lessons, although increasing availability of administrative data should shed further light on these issues: workers bear some of the burden of taxes on the rich, but the extent of such incidence depends on heterogeneity across workers as well as labour and product market characteristics. The largest part of the burden of corporation tax is likely shared by business owners and workers at the higher end of the income distribution. There is limited evidence of any trickle-down effects and, if anything, evidence is stronger for ‘trickle-up’ from benefits to low-income individuals (Zidar, 2019).]]></description><link>https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/deabete/trickle-up-over-trickle-down-when-taxed.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10th graade/Deabete/Trickle up over trickle down when taxed.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 22:09:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Untitled]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Logan M. Otremba<br>Ms. Luond<br>Honors English 2<br>15 December 2024<br>A Peek into Creon’s Cursed State of Mind<br>After it is found that Antigone’s brother has been given a proper burial, Creon sends his guards to find the perpetrator and investigate this matter. In which Creon has time to ponder the punishment for the perpetrator.<br>My guards better find this insolent human that has committed such a deed which goes against my very command of this city. I’ll personally dispatch brutality upon this wretched criminal by my own unforgiving hands. They shall feel coursing throughout their body the concentrated power of ten thousand suns'. As I will poison them by giving them just a bare nonlethal dose of hemlock. Just enough so it’s as if they were to meet the same fate of the late Socrates.<br>So let the lands tremble in my wake for the torture that will unfurl. Their cries will howl in the bright night. Then I’ll let them see with their bare eyes as I push a needle further and further under their nail. Then peeling off the nail to leave the skin festering in the elements. After which such dastardly tendrils shall be burned. I’ll take and place them on molten steel that yearns for the victim's blood. I then shall slide sharpened steel slowly strongly subjecting such surreal sensation, scaring the very depths of their soul.<br>Their blood-curdling screams will be The Music of the Night to which my ears have the pleasure of. I truly see it as a blessing in disguise with their folly being their gruesome demise. Such be the life of a criminal, that goes against my absolute laws of the land. For a fact, the Gods will be overjoyed once I’m through with this criminal. That should set things right as rightfully be when you make a wimp right out of me.]]></description><link>https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/english/essays/a-peek-into-creon’s-cursed-state-of-mind.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10th graade/English/Essays/A Peek into Creon’s Cursed State of Mind.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 17:44:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[enlgish animal farm]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>In C#, you cannot directly invoke a managed DLL using rundll32.exe as rundll32.exe is meant for calling unmanaged DLLs. However, you can create a mixed-mode or native method within a DLL that rundll32.exe can call. Alternatively, you could write a console application in C# instead.<br>Here's a workaround with C# that simulates the approach by using a method to print "Hello World," but keep in mind this won't work with rundll32.exe directly because rundll32 expects unmanaged methods (like those written in C or C++).<br><br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To export a method from the managed DLL that can be called by rundll32.exe, you need to use the DllExport attribute, which is available via some third-party libraries such as UnmanagedExports.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Install the package:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```bash<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Install-Package UnmanagedExports -Version 1.2.7<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<br>
<br>Build the Project
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing the code, compile the DLL:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```bash<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dotnet build<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<br>
<br>Call the DLL with rundll32.exe
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you should be able to call the DLL via rundll32.exe:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```bash<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rundll32.exe HelloWorldDll.dll,Run<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<br><br>
<br>
The DllExport attribute is used to export the method so it can be called via rundll32.exe.

<br>
The method Run is the entry point that rundll32.exe expects to call, and it prints "Hello World" to the console.

<br>
You must use CallingConvention.StdCall because rundll32.exe expects methods with this calling convention.

<br>Note: This is not a typical use case for C# and managed code. Normally, rundll32.exe is used for invoking unmanaged DLL functions, so this workaround leverages external libraries to handle method exports in a managed environment.<br>**]]></description><link>https://pythongithcode.github.io/AP-EURO/10th-graade/things-stuff.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10th graade/things stuff.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 18:24:02 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
